Hygieia is recommended to use maven 3.3.9 and JDK 8. Still I haven't been able to build it in the AWS environment. On the other side a local env in my personal computer with a docker container builds successfuly.

Orchestration not done, ran out of time.
CloudFormation for AWS and ansible, couldn't finish. List of steps was in the works and detailed in the google document.

AWS setup:
Jenkins at http://18.221.62.190:8080
